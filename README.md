# "Best TAs Controller - Endpoints"
### Description: 
Make a new web api project in Visual Studio Code and create a new controller with the name BestTAsController.
Create these endpoints:
- Create an endpoint called AddTwoNumbers and pass in two variables using the route.
    - In AddTwoNumbers, take in the variables from the route, add them together, and return the sum.
- Create an endpoint called ReverseIt and let it pass in 1 variable using the route.
    - In ReverseIt, take in the variable from the route, reverse it, and return the solution.
- Create an endpoint called SayHello, and let it pass in 1 variable using the route.
    - In SayHello, take in the variable from the route, and return hello + variable.
- Create another endpoint called SayHelloTwo.
    - Instead of just using a variable in the route, use a "model" to enter in the name.
    - Hint: (new folder/ file, get and set, constructor).
